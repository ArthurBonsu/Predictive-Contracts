Predictive Contracts
This repository provides tools and scripts to analyze, extract, and embed opcodes from compiled smart contracts, enabling predictive and comparative contract analysis. It involves generating vocabularies, embeddings, and mappings between opcodes and embedded data representations.

Project Structure
This project involves the following steps for processing opcodes:

Extract Opcodes from Original File Folder (Optional)
Extract Multiple Opcodes and IDs (Compulsory)
Generate Text Opcodes for the extracted opcodes and IDs
Build Vocabulary for generated opcodes and IDs
Convert Vocabulary to Word2Vec format, providing a way to read it as text
Embed Opcodes using the generated Word2Vec vocabulary
Organize Embedded Opcodes into two folders:
Folder with IDs
Folder without IDs
Convert Embedded Opcodes to Text files
Build Relationships between embedded opcodes using paths
Design Checker Code to implement the analysis
File Paths

Continued Process Steps
Embed Opcodes with and without IDs: Create two folders for:

Embedded opcodes with IDs
Embedded opcodes without IDs
Each embedded file will be saved in .npy format.

Map Opcodes to Embeddings by Path:

Code for Path Mapping:
Opcodes without ID
Opcodes with ID
Link Mapped Opcodes to Embeddings

Detect Dynamic and Static Parts:

Implementation 1
Implementation 2
Notes
The process also allows for automatic change detection in the original files, enabling real-time analysis and embedding updates as files are modified.

This README should help collaborators understand and replicate the structured steps for predictive contract analysis within your repository.
