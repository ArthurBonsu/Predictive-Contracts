Steps Summary 
1. Extract Opecode from Original File  Folder[optional]
2. Extract Multiple Opecode and Id[Compulsory] 
3. Develop the Text Opecode for the Multiple Opecode and Text ID  generated 
4. Develop the Vocabulary for the Opecode and Ids generated as 
5. Provide a means for reading the word2vec generated from the vocabulary either by converting it as a text file as
6. Try to embedd the previous opecode using the word2vec generated 
7. Embedding Done
8. Now with Embedded Opecodes, we have two folders,they are: 
a) Has ID  
b) No ID   
9. We convert them to text files 
10. We try to build a relationship between opecodes and embeds using paths 
11. We design a checker -First code, and two implementations

Continued Process

1. We have the code for continued scenarios
Assuming we have two folders that have 
a) Opcode with ID 
b) Opcodes with no ID

2. We will then embedd them, creating two folders with 
a) Embedded code with ID
b) Embedded code with no ID
.This creates several embedded files known as npy in two folders
We will try to change Embedded Files to text 

<This was done in Code Second>
3. Since each file within the Opcode Folder and the Embedd Folder has a path name, we will try to map them together by path 
a) Code FOr Mapping Path to Opecode (For ones with no ID)
b) Code For Mapping Path to Opcode (For ones with ID)

4. We connect the Mapped Opcodes to their corresponding embedded Files

5. We try to identify the dynamic parts and static parts
Thus Implementation 1 and Implementation 2 

Assuming the Original Files  change, we want to be able to detecht changes
